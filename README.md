### Hi there fellow otakus👋
I am currently not active in GitHub community as I am migrating to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/codingotaku). 

You can find most of my pet projects here, I'll keep updating them until I completely move out. (The repos will remain here for a bit more in "archived" mode) 


- 🔭 I try to promote FOSS in my free time- through videos and blogs, your contribution might help me do this more regularly!
